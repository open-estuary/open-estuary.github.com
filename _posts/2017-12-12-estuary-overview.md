<h1><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Estuary: A complete open source solution for ARM based systems<a href="">
</a></strong></span></h1>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Estuary is a complete open source project for ARM64 ecosystem</strong></span>.</span> It provides a total solution for general-purpose computer based on aarch64 architecture. Anyone can quickly bring up an ARM64 platform - both software and hardware with Estuary!

May be you are just a user to ARM64 computer or a community developer who works on aarch64 platform, or a student or scholar working on ARM64 hardware in university… anyway, no matter whoever you are, wherever you are, so long as you want to work, develop, debug, estimate, validate on an ARM64 platform, <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Estuary is for you!</strong></span>

<span style="color: #000000;">So get started with Estuary and explore various features and tools which we support for your ARM64 platform</span>...
<h2>Main Targets:</h2>
<p class="disqus">The major goals for Estuary project are:</p>

<ol class="disqus">
    <li>A stable\available quick start solution based on ARM64 computer, so that anyone can easily get and bring up the complete development environment, so that you can just focus on your particular field quickly.</li>
	<li>A common basic platform, which should be sustainable and will be continuously improved, can attract\absorb and integrate all 3rd part achievement ceaselessly.</li>
	<li>Sufficient technological documentation, so that any user or partner can easily get useful help from it.</li>
	<li>Simple and effective communication forum for ARM64 ecosystem, so that users can interact and share each other to improve ARM64 ecosystem.</li>
	<li>A bug tracking system, so that anyone can raise, track and help to resolve the issues, this will help to mature the solution and enhance the ecosystem.</li>
	<li>Multiple ARM64-based hardware platforms, and related software to speed up the ARM64 ecosystem development.</li>
</ol>
The most key goal of Estuary project is to support, enable and speed up the maturity of ARM64 ecosystem.

<p class="disqus"><strong>Operation System:</strong>
Two main kinds of OS will be enabled, one is based on Windows, another is based on Linux. For Linux OS, not only the latest kernel will be enabled for Estuary, various distributions will be enabled for it too, include but not limited to Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenEmbedded, Debian, Redhat and etc.</p>
<p class="disqus">The linux kernel source can be obtained by  <strong>git clone <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="https://github.com/open-estuary/kernel" target="_blank">https://github.com/open-estuary/kernel.git</a></span></strong></p>
<p class="disqus">All prebuilt kernel image\dtb\grub and other binaries can be obtained in Download-Rootfolder/release/&lt;version&gt;/linux/common/&lt;board type&gt;/.
All validated distributions can be obtained in Download-Rootfolder/release/&lt;version&gt;/linux/&lt;distro name&gt;/common.
More detail documentations are available in Download-Rootfolder/release/&lt;version&gt;/linux/common/&lt;board type&gt;/documentation.</p>
</li>
	<li><strong>Virtualization Technologies:</strong>
Multi-kinds of virtualization technologies will also be enabled for Estuary, e.g.:<span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Docker</a></span>\<span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="https://linuxcontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lxc</a></span>, <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="external">KVM</a></span>, <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="http://www.xenproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Xen</a></span>, <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="external">Qemu</a></span>, <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">OpenStack\swift</a></span>, <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Vmware, HHVM</a></span> or <span style="color: #0066cc;"><a style="color: #0066cc;" href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">CloudFoundry</a></span> and so on.</li>
